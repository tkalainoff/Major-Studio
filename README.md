### Data Review
Now that you have learned about the SDGs and the different organizations,       initiatives and locations involved, try to research actual data sets that might be interesting to you. Find data sets that you find interesting, that are not too large (> 100,000 entries) and not too small (80<).

### Concepts and Sketches
After reviewing the data and data set imagine 3 different quantitative visualization concepts with 3 different data sets. For each concept, create a hand-drawn sketch and write a paragraph about the idea.
The sketch really should be hand-drawn, not done with a computer. Please design it for a format of 16:9 and make it self explanatory, so that anyone can understand what they are looking at even without your explanation.

#### The paragraph includes:
- Title of the visualization 
- What are questions that you want to explore with this visualization?
- Which quantitative dataset is used? 
- What are the properties of the data set?
- How many data points, what's the quality of the data etc?
- Which visualization method is used and why?

1)	Maternal Mortality Rates (3.1.1 Dataset)
•	How deadly is childbirth in the US?
•	US vs. highest developed countries over time (vs. lowest developed countries)
•	How does the US’s Maternal Mortality Rate Compare to Least Developed and Most Developed Countries
•	Indicator_3.1.1%3A_Maternal_mortality_ratio.csv from https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal/countryprofiles/usa
•	185 rows, 2001-2017, is there more source data to aggregate from? For racial data?
•	Line Graph (multiple lines)

2)	AMI (mean and median) (10.2.1 Dataset)
•	
•	US vs. European countries, – dispersion? Variance?
•	Indicator_10.2.1%3A_Proportion_of_people_living_below_50_percent_of_median_income__percent_
•	161 rows, bottom 50% quartile, years vary for each entry, only percentages… could we access all data properties from source data to do more extensive calculations? Such as mean and median? And see dispersion or variance over time?

3)	Access to 2G, 3G, 4G Network (9.c.1 Dataset)
•	Access to technology over time in the UK
•	Indicator_9.c.1%3A_Proportion_of_population_covered_by_at_least_a_4G_mobile_network__percent_ from https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal/countryprofiles/usa
•	~220 row, years 2012-2018
•	Indicator_9.c.1%3A_Proportion_of_population_covered_by_at_least_a_3G_mobile_network__percent_ from https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal/countryprofiles/usa
•	~220 rows, years 2007-2018
•	Stacked Area Graph for one country
•	Stacked Bar Graph across Least Developed Countries
•	Small Multiples??
