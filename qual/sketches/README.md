### Data Review
Now that you have learned about the SDGs and the different organizations,       initiatives and locations involved, try to research actual data sets that might be interesting to you. Find data sets that you find interesting, that are not too large (> 100,000 entries) and not too small (80<).

### Concepts and Sketches
After reviewing the data and data set imagine 3 different qualitative visualization concepts with 3 different data sets. For each concept, create a hand-drawn sketch and write a paragraph about the idea.
The sketch really should be hand-drawn, not done with a computer. Please design it for a format of 16:9 and make it self explanatory, so that anyone can understand what they are looking at even without your explanation.

#### The paragraph includes:
- Title of the visualization 
- What are questions that you want to explore with this visualization?
- Which quantitative dataset is used? 
- What are the properties of the data set?
- How many data points, what's the quality of the data etc?
- Which visualization method is used and why?
