- Imagine a plan to get to your high fidelity mockup in code

The current dataset pulled as a CSV from the SGD data portal summarizes indicator 3.1.1 Maternal Morality Ratio per 100,000 live births. It contains 185 observations and 89 variables with usable data. It spans over 18 years (from 2000 -2017) and includes 185 countries categorized into 22 global regions are accounted for in the dataset.
